          <li><b>Goal:<b> Detect pleiotropic loci associated with cardiometabolic traits and complex diseases to identify potential novel therapeutic targets.</li>
          <li>Performed the multi-trait GWAS and colocalization analyses between traits and GTEx eQTL data for a project centered around Alzheimer’s disease. I worked with my co-first author to perform these same experiments in a project centered around atherosclerosis. I also worked on the literature review to assess which genes were potential therapeutic targets.</li>
          <li>We detected potential therapeutic targets including DOCK4 for Alzheimer’s disease and PCSK6 for atherosclerosis as well as several other novel pleiotropic loci in both the Alzheimer’s-disease-centric and the atherosclerosis-centric multi-trait GWAS projects.</li>
